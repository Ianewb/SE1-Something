Project Vision: This is a Calendar application that can recognize multiple people, support chatting or comments, recognize event proposals, allow votes on times, recognize resources, and disallow scheduling of two groups to the same resources. We may add or change some features in the future, but this is the baseline we have so far.

**Functional:**
The system should recognize a host who will have the ability to add people to the calendar through e-mail, or some other form and adjust or restrict the administrative access of other members of the Calendar.
The User Host should be able to set and restrict access for different members
The System should let the host start with the highest level of access and be able to promote or demote the authority level of other members,  
They system should recognize new members of the Calendar as having the lowest access( adjustable by the host) 
The User Members of the lowest priority are only able to view the events on the Calendar and comment on event discussions.
The User Member should only be able to view events and allocated resources 
They System should be able to recognize the resources that are available for each day, and whether or not those resources are in use
The System should support Host facilitated discussion boards per event that host can adjust to be open or closed to responses.
The system should support voting, between members of appropriate access level, on which resources should be used for an event given time-slots that can be voted on, and automatically disqualify resources that have passed.
The user Host should be able to add events and initiate votes on available time slots.
**Non-Functional:**
All forms of communication are expressed in English
All event dates are posted and formatted according to the Gregorian calendar
The timezone standard will be in Central Daylight Time
